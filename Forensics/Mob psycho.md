grep — Command-line tool to search for text patterns in files.

-i — Makes the search case-insensitive (picoctf, PicoCTF, PICOCTF, etc.).

-R — Recursively searches all directories and subdirectories starting from the current one.

picoCTF — The string you're searching for (often the format of a flag in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges).

* — Wildcard meaning "all files and directories" in the current directory.

# 🧠 What You Learned From This CTF:
#### 🔧 1. APKs are just zip archives.

#### 🔍 2. Pattern Searching Techniques:
Using grep -iR to search recursively through all extracted files for common flag patterns (picoCTF, flag, etc.).

#### 3. Hex Decoding Skills:
You encountered a hex-encoded flag and used:
xxd -r -p
