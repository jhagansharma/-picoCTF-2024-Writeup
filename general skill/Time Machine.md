## conclusion  
### 1. Git keeps history — even if the file is changed or deleted  
- Git records every commit (change) with:  
- A unique commit hash  
- An author and timestamp  
- A commit message  

Even if the file with the sensitive information is later removed or modified, the data can still be recovered by checking older commits.  

### 2. git log can reveal secrets in commit messages  
- Commit messages should ideally describe the change, but in this challenge, the flag was stored in the commit message itself.  
- In real life, developers sometimes accidentally commit passwords, API keys, or secrets in commit messages — attackers can find them the same way you found the flag.
