# Secret of the Polyglot

# Conclusion
This challenge showed us how information can be hidden in files by simply changing their extensions and how to recover it. As a forensic analyst, you will encounter many similar examples of files being saved with incorrect extensions to evade analysis. It is always a good idea to open up suspicious files in a Hex Editor to find their true extensions.
