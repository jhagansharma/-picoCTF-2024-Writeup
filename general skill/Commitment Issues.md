    create flag
```
This shows a list of commits.
You notice one commit message says "create flag" — that’s when the flag was added.

Go back to that commit
Copy its commit hash (like e720dc26a1a55405fbdf4d338d465335c439fb3e) and run:

```
git checkout e720dc26a1a55405fbdf4d338d465335c439fb3e
```
This switches the files to how they looked at that time.

Read the file

`cat message.txt`
Boom — the flag is there:

# What you learned
- Git remembers everything, even if files are changed or deleted.
- You can travel back in time to old commits using:
- git log → see commit history
- git checkout <commit_hash> → go to that version
- In security/CTFs, you can use this to recover accidentally exposed secrets like flags, passwords, or API keys.
